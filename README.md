To install all  the dependencies for both the backend and frontend, from the root run the following command:

```
npm install
```

_**Note:** You need to have installed a version higher than 7 of NPM._

You can find more details for the setup of the backend or the frontend in their respective folders; **if you find instructions about installing dependencies for development in these folders, you can ignore them**.
